### Greetings! 👋

Welcome to my tech journey! Let me take you through the twists and turns that have shaped my path in the ever-evolving world of technology.

#### Early Curiosity: Nurtured at NIT Rourkela

As a young Computer Science undergrad <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/aa/27/62/aa2762f2783a3026e13e4a888814fe21.gif" width="30"/>, I embarked on this journey at the esteemed National Institute of Technology Rourkela. My initial encounters with Python ignited a spark, propelling me into the enchanting realm of coding.

#### Diving into Development: Crafting Digital Identities

With newfound skills in hand, I delved into web development—crafting my digital footprint using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Each line of code was a stroke on the canvas of my technological journey. 

#### Unveiling the Data World: From Internships to Industry

The journey into the data world began with my internship experiences, each adding a layer of expertise to my skill set.

- **Strategy Analyst at Red Carpet Up**: My first step into the field of data began here, where I delved into analyzing business strategies and market trends. This experience laid the foundation for my future endeavors in data analytics and strategy formulation. I worked on a variety of tasks using python and PostgreSQL.

- **Research Intern at Indian Urban Data Exchange (IUDX)**: My passion for data privacy led me to this research internship, where I focused on developing a platform addressing the challenges of data privacy in the context of ML models. The project aimed to implement solutions on Intel SGX, ensuring secure computation and preserving privacy in data exchanges. This experience expanded my horizons, allowing me to explore the intersection of data science, security, and privacy.

- **Business Analyst Trainee at Finlatics**: Here, I embarked on a journey of discovery, working on three diverse projects. The spotlight was on PowerBI, as I leveraged its capabilities to derive insights and visualize data in innovative ways.

- **Data Analyst Trainee at Trainity**: My next stop was a role as a Data Analyst Trainee, where I honed my SQL skills through hands-on project work, diving deeper into the realm of data manipulation and analysis.([Data Analyst Projects Repository](https://github.com/shivtikoo/DataAnalytics))


- **Data Science Intern at Digit Insurance**: It was here that I delved into the world of data science with an up-and-coming insurance startup, Digit Insurance. My focus shifted towards building a commercial vehicle insurance claim prediction model. However, my journey didn't stop at model development; I immersed myself in the realm of MLOps. I transformed the project into an automated pipeline using MLFlow, saving several models in the MLFlow directory. Each month, upon dataset update, the pipeline retrains models and selects the best-performing one for production deployment based on its F1 score. The model I developed is currently in use by the company, driving real-world impact. ([MLOps Repository](https://github.com/shivtikoo/MLOps))

#### Navigating the Academia: The IIT Hyderabad Chapter

Transitions often mark the beginning of a new chapter. As I transferred to the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, my journey took a scholarly turn. Here, amidst the academic rigors, my passion for AI found fertile ground. I started working on various machine learning projects to get a better feel of what the domain is about and it never fails to surprise me. ([ML Repository](https://github.com/shivtikoo/ML))

#### Exploring New Horizons: Academic Endeavors

In my penultimate semester, I embarked on a journey of academic exploration, delving into uncharted territories and pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and imagination.

- **Survey of Cache Replacement Policies**: As part of my academic pursuits, I conducted an in-depth survey of advancements in cache replacement policies. Exploring the intricacies of caching mechanisms, I meticulously analyzed existing policies, evaluating their strengths and limitations. Drawing from this comprehensive study, I proposed a novel cache replacement policy aimed at addressing the evolving needs of modern computing systems. This endeavor challenged me to think critically and innovatively in the domain of computer architecture and system optimization. ([Cache Replacement Policy Survey Repository](https://github.com/shivtikoo/Computer_Architecture))

- **Contribution to 5G Core Networks**: In parallel with my exploration of cache replacement policies, I made significant contributions to the realm of 5G core networks. Collaborating with peers and mentors, I ventured into the complexities of next-generation telecommunications infrastructure, seeking to enhance performance and efficiency. In this project I worked to make a novel contribution of a network function- User Data Store Function (UDSF) to the Open Air Interface 5G Core. 

These academic endeavors epitomized my commitment to pushing boundaries, fostering innovation, and embracing challenges head-on. They were pivotal in shaping my academic journey and preparing me for the dynamic landscape of technology and research.


#### Pursuing the Unseen: Delving into Explainable AI

Driven by a thirst for knowledge, I embarked on a quest for explainability in AI. From dissecting causal relations in temporal datasets to unraveling the mysteries of system downtime, each endeavor deepened my understanding of the intricate AI landscape. I worked on a windows 10 log dataset to obtain the causal relations in the dataset and in turn better understand the reason behind downtime of teh system. 

#### Embracing the Fusion: Where Hardware Meets Intelligence

As my journey unfolds, I discover myself standing at the thrilling crossroads where the intricate dance of hardware architecture intersects with the boundless realm of artificial intelligence. Here, amidst the whirring of processors and the humming of algorithms, I embark on a voyage of innovation and discovery.

In this dynamic domain, I am not merely a spectator but a fearless explorer, venturing into uncharted territories with a spirit of curiosity and determination. My quest begins with the exploration of compression techniques tailored for the rugged landscapes of edge devices. Armed with ingenuity and precision, I seek to unravel the secrets of squeezing optimal performance from constrained hardware, paving the way for efficient and agile AI deployment in the most challenging environments.

Yet, my journey doesn't end there. With a thirst for deeper understanding, I dive headfirst into the enigmatic waters of neuromorphic computing. Here, amidst the whispers of neural networks and the murmurs of synaptic connections, I seek to unlock the mysteries of brain-inspired architectures, envisioning a future where machines mimic the elegance and efficiency of the human mind.

But innovation knows no bounds, and I find myself drawn to the forefront of cutting-edge research in explainable AI. With a blend of intuition and intellect, I unravel the complexities of machine learning models, shedding light on the shadowy corners of black-box algorithms. Through meticulous experimentation and daring exploration, I pave the path towards transparency and understanding, bridging the gap between human cognition and artificial intelligence.

#### Future Horizons: A Journey of Discovery

The realm of artificial intelligence beckons with its promise of transformation and innovation. It's a realm where boundaries blur and imagination knows no limits. The surge in AI advancements fills me with a profound sense of purpose, as I see an opportunity not just to witness history but to actively shape it.
